            <h6>Our take on the traditional Brazilian recipe of pão de queijo.</h6>
            <p>
            Pão de queijo comes from Minas Gerais, a place known for its mines and good food.
            The land there is vast and holds many of Brazil’s dairy farms. In a time when wheat
            wasn’t popular, these farms used the native cassava root for everything, including
            bread. When they mixed leftover cheese, excess milk, eggs and cassava (tapioca
            starch) pão de queijo was created, making use of ingredients farmers had immediately
            available at almost no cost. With time, these became a popular snack and spread all
            throughout Brazil. Recipes changed a bit, but the essence remains the same still today:
            a delicious cheesy bread.</p>

              <h3>Paloma</h3>
              <p>
                The Brazilian part of Paz Bakery, was living in Canada and missed her favourite
                Brazilian treat called pão de queijo (cheese bun) and decided to try to make them using
                what she could find locally, just like Brazilians did when they created this treat. But she
                wasn’t only looking for taste, or the reminiscent smell when the buns are baking, she
                wanted to create a feeling of home.

              <h3>Andrew</h3>
              <p>
                The Canadian half of Paz Bakery, suggested trying Oka. Not only
                was it one of the oldest and most traditional Canadian cheeses but he knew it had the
                same strength of flavour and aroma indicative of Brazilian pão de queijo. We were so
                happy with this discovery because it was a blend of our cultures. Much like how we feel
                for each other, this pairing of ingredients was a perfect match.

              <h3>Cassava</h3>
              <p>Also known as yuca, manioc or Brazilian arrowroot, it is a
              naturally gluten-free starchy root vegetable or tuber. Native to South America, it is one
              of the most drought-tolerant crops, being able to withstand difficult growing conditions
              and marginal soils, giving good yield where many other crops wouldn’t do well. In Brazil,
              it grows in every corner of the country and as an indigenous inheritance, Brazilians
              learned the importance of this tuber and how versatile it really is. It can be eaten whole,
              fried or boiled, grated or ground into flour to make our delicious Cheese Dots.</p>

              <h3>Canadian Oka</h3>
              <p>
                Oka is a Trappist (or monastic) style of cheese created in 1983 in the city of Oka,
              Quebec. Brother Alphonse Juin came from Bellefontaine, France with a recipe of Port-
              du-Salut cheese, that he adjusted and tweaked to create a unique cheese. The cheese
              won first prize at the Montreal Exhibition that same year. Since then, Oka has become
              a Canadian classic.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1981 the monks sold the recipe to Agropur, who are the sole producers of Oka. The
                cheese hasn’t lost its tradition though, it is still made according to the original recipe,
                using the same facility and same aging cellars the monks used.

              <p>
                In Brazil, pão de queijo is everywhere and eaten at every moment of the day. In
                Canada, pão de queijo is not well known, but those who know Cheese Dots, simply love
                these delicious snacks. Our goal is to make Cheese Dots as popular in Canada as they
                are in their native country.
